"""Component is the building block for desmod models.

Hierarchy
---------

A desmod model consists of a directed acyclical graph (DAG) of
:class:`Component` subclasses. Each Component is composed of zero or more child
Components. A single top-level Component class is passed to the
:func:`~desmod.simulation.simulate()` function to initiate simulation.

The :class:`Component` hierarchy does not define the behavior of a model, but
instead exists as a tool to build large models out of composable and
encapsulated pieces.

Connections
-----------

Components connect to other components via connection objects. Each component
is responsible for declaring the names of external connections as well as make
connections for its child components. The final network of inter-component
connections is neither directed (a connection object may enable two-way
communication), acyclic (groups of components may form cyclical connections),
nor constrained to match the component hierarchy.

Ultimately, a connection between two components means that each component
instance has a [pythonic] reference to the connection object.

In the spirit of Python, the types connection objects are flexible and dynamic.
A connection object may be of any type--it is up to the connected components to
cooperatively decide how to use the connection object for communication. That
said, some object types are more useful than others for connections. Some
useful connection object types include:

 * :class:`desmod.queue.Queue`
 * :class:`simpy.resources.resource.Resource`

Processes
---------

A component may have zero or more simulation processes
(:class:`simpy.events.Process`). It is these processes that give a model its
simulation-time behavior. The process methods declared by components are
started at simulation time. These "standing" processes may dynamically launch
addtional processes using `self.env.process()`.

Use Cases
---------

Given the flexibility components to have zero or more children, zero or more
processes, and zero or more connections, it can be helpful to give names to
the various roles components may play in a model.

 * Structural Component -- a component with child components, but no processes
 * Behavioral Component -- a component with processes, but no child components
 * Hybrid Component -- a component with child components and processes
 * State Component -- a component with neither children or processes

It is typical for the top-level component in a model to be purely structural,
while behavioral components are leaves in the model DAG.

A component with neither children or processes may still be useful. Such a
component could, for example, be used as a connection object.
